# MLOps + GenAI Portfolio (RAG + Reliability)

This repository contains my selected personal projects focused on **GenAI (RAG workflows)**, **privacy-aware pipelines**, and **reliability-first operational engineering**.

## 📌 Projects

### 1) RAG Incident Assistant (FastAPI)
A lightweight RAG-style assistant that retrieves relevant runbook/incident knowledge and provides grounded troubleshooting suggestions for faster triage.

➡️ Folder: `Project-1-RAG-Incident-Assistant/`

---

### 2) PII Detection & Remediation Pipeline (Amazon Comprehend aligned)
A privacy-aware log processing pipeline that detects PII entities and masks/remediates sensitive values before forwarding logs to observability platforms.

➡️ Folder: `Project-2-PII-Detection-Remediation/`

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- AWS (CloudWatch / Lambda / S3) *(project dependent)*
- FastAPI
- GenAI (RAG concepts)
- Amazon Comprehend (PII detection)
- Observability mindset (SRE/AIOps aligned)

## ✅ Goal of these projects
To demonstrate production-ready thinking around:
- reliable deployments
- safe log pipelines (PII protection)
- faster incident triage using GenAI workflows
